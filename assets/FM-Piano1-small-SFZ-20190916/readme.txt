Version 2019-09-16

Sound samples and sound bank made by Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org> for the
FreePats project. Imitation of the Yamaha DX7 electric piano, a FM sythesis
instrument that was popular in the 1980s. These sound samples simulate the "E.
Piano 1" patch of the DX7, used in many 1980s popular songs.

Recorded from Hexter software synthesizer. Hexter is a free software program
that accurately models the sound generation algorithm of the original
instrument: http://dssi.sourceforge.net/hexter.html

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages:
