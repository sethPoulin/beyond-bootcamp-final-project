# Ear Training Tutor

This web app helps users learn to recognize the interval length (in semitones) between notes.  

The user first selects which octaves will be in play (up to four), and then selects the maximum interval length (from 2 to 12 semitones).  The user then clicks start and a random note from within the selected octave range is played, while its location on the keyboard is highlighted in blue.  A few seconds later, a second random note is played.  The user must correctly guess the second note by clicking on the keyboard.  Incorrect notes will display as red, correct notes will display as green.

The app is currently functional in Chrome and Firefox.  It is not yet responsive and only works on desktop configurations.
