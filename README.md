This web app helps you learn to recognize the interval length (in semitones) between notes.  

The user first selects which octaves will be in play (up to four), and then selects the maximum interval length (from 2 to 16 semitones).  The user then clicks start and a random note from within the selected octave range is played, while its location on the keyboard is highlighted in blue.  A few seconds later, a second random note is played.  The user must correctly guess the second note by clicking on the keyboard.  Incorrect notes will display as red, correct notes will display as green.

In future versions, the interval length from the first note will display as the user hovers over the piano keys.  E.g. if the distance between the hovered key and the first note's key is 4 semitones, '4 semitones' will be displayed.
